## Set-up

Use the package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) to install this project.
This project requires mongodb to work so either you have a local mongodb or you can use a cloud hosted one. You can use the template.env as a base, generate the .env file and provide a valid url. 

### To clone first

```bash
git clone project
```

### To install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then create a .env file in the root of the project similar to the template.env (providing a valid mongo URL).

### To run
```bash
npm start
```

Then go to the url http://localhost:3000/
